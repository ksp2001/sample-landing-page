# landing page for a personal website
A website layout to apply the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and CSS grid, not using bootstrap or javascript.
Includes use of media queries to make it responsive over a variety of devices.
What needs to be improved - uses pixels to position different elements, meaning it will be different over different devices.
For my projects after this, I've learned to use rem units to help make the sites responsive.
